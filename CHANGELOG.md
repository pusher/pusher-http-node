## 5.0.1 (2022-01-24)

[FIXED] Incorrect `require` on `version.js` was causing a compilation error in Webpack
[FIXED] Inconsistent encoding for shared secret between other SDKs

## 5.0.0 (2021-02-18)

[BREAKING CHANGE] `trigger` now accepts a `params` _object_ instead of a `socket_id` as the third parameter.

[ADDED] Support for requesting channel attributes as part of a `trigger` and `triggerBatch` request via an `info` parameter.

## 4.0.2 (2020-11-30)

[FIXED] Workaround for a [Webpack bug](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/4742) (thanks @JJ-Kidd)

## 4.0.1 (2020-11-09)

[FIXED] The type definitions had drifted out of sync with the implementation.

## 4.0.0 (2020-10-20)

[BREAKING CHANGE] Methods that previously took callbacks now return promises.

- `trigger`, `triggerBatch`, `get`, and `post` return a promise which resolves
  to a [`Response`](https://github.com/node-fetch/node-fetch#class-response) (as provided by [node-fetch](https://github.com/node-fetch/node-fetch)),
  or rejects to a `RequestError`. Of particular note:
  - `Response` has a `status` where is used to have a `statusCode`.
  - `RequestError` has a `status` where is used to have a `statusCode` to
    mirror the above.
  - `Response` has
    [`json`](https://github.com/node-fetch/node-fetch#bodyjson),
    [`text`](https://github.com/node-fetch/node-fetch#bodytext), etc to
    access the body where before it exposed `body` as a string.

[BREAKING CHANGE] The `Pusher` constructor no longer accepts `proxy` or `keepAlive`, but instead accepts [`agent`](https://nodejs.org/api/https.html#https_class_https_agent).

- To configure a proxy, use [`https://www.npmjs.com/package/https-proxy-agent`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/https-proxy-agent) or similar:

```js
const pusher = new Pusher.forURL(process.env.PUSHER_URL, {
  agent: new HttpsProxyAgent("http://localhost:8321"),
})
```

- To configure keep alive:

```js
const pusher = new Pusher.forURL(process.env.PUSHER_URL, {
  agent: new https.Agent({ keepAlive: true }),
})
```
